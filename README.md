# DotaProto
Playing around with Dota 2's protobuf stuff from C++

1. Download & build protobuf-3.5.1 (the version Dota 2 currently uses)
2. Compile protos from https://github.com/SteamDatabase/GameTracking-Dota2/tree/master/Protobufs
3. Put them in an in-directory folder DotaMessages and compile this as a 64-bit DLL
4. Hope nothing crashes?
